# quiz-challenge

## Description

This is my fourth challenge in the UCSD web dev course. The purpose of this site is to apply what I have learned in this course so far. The focus of this project was to bring all the different aspects of of web development that i have learned so far together. I had to work in html, css, and js to bring this project together.

- When someone clicks the start button they start a timed quiz counting down from 100 seconds.
- When someone answers they question they are presented with the next one.
- When someone answers the question wrong 10 seconds is subtracted from their score.
- When all the questions are answered or when the time runs out they can see their score and are presented with a prompt to enter their initals.
- When you enter your initals you are given the option to go back to the intro page or reset the score list.
## Installation
